## Nilsbergs Pizzeria - JavaScript Project 🍕

_Project Description/_
I have created a "pizza bot" using JavaScript. It works like a small chat-robot where you can order food. You start by entering your name, then you choose between pizza, pasta, or salad, and finally, you pick the specific variety you want.

_My Process/_
I started by figuring out the JavaScript code, and I think I've managed to get it working pretty well. I wasn't happy with the fact that the bot just continued to the next step if I pressed a random number that wasn't on the list. Because of that, I researched and figured out how to use while loops. This makes the program loop back and ask again until a correct number is entered, ensuring the order is right.

_Future Improvements/_
If I had more time, I would have liked to:

\*Create a more realistic website with the menu displayed directly on the background.

\*\*Add a sidebar where you can type your order directly into a box.

\*\*\*Make it possible to order multiple items at once and choose between different sizes.
